<h1> PoissonDistribution</h1>

<p>
-> Scope: Definition of spawn generation in source
Use the PoissonDistribution to generate agents with a Poisson process.
The Poisson process is a random process.
Hence, the generation time of a specific agent is independent from other generation times.
The Poisson distribution and the exponential distribution are related.
The reciprocal value of the Poisson parameter is the mean inter arrival time used in the exponential distribution.
