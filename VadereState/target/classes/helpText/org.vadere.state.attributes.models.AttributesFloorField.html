<h2> Field: cacheType</h2>
<p>
If true, the floor field will be initialized based on a previously cached version. The
cached floor field will be search at <span class='local_link'>cacheDir</span>. The file name of the cached floor
field has two parts: "[cacheDir]/[hash-of-AttributesFloorField-Topography]_[targetId].ffcache"

The hash ensures that only valid version of the cache will be used. If something changed in
the topography or in this attributes settings (except of <span class='local_link'>cacheDir</span>) the hash will
differ an a new floor field is created and saved at initialization time.

Thus the created hash file can be moved to a different location without invalidating the
saved floor field.

<h2> Field: obstacleGridPenalty</h2>

<h2> Field: potentialFieldResolution</h2>
<p>
These attribute values should only be used if createMethod.isUsingCellGrid() == true.

TODO [refactoring]: However potentialFieldResolution is also used for the @link org.vadere.simulator.models.potential.solver.timecost.ITimeCostFunction
for the density computation, i.e. it is the resolution of the matrix used in the discrete convolution. This should be changed!
Furthermore, theare are many unused parameters in <a href='/helpText/org.vadere.state.attributes.models.AttributesTimeCost.html' class='class_link'>AttributesTimeCost</a>.
Solution:
(1) change AttributesTimeCost timeCostAttributes to ITimeCostFunction like the potential classes in AttributesOSM
(2) split AttributesTimeCost timeCostAttributes into multiple classes
(3) add a new AttributesTimeCost into the top level (i.e. attributesModel) json.

specifies path in which a cache of the target floor field is saved. This path is relative to
the executable. @JsonView(...) allows the cache hashing to move the cache directory without
invalidating existing caches.
